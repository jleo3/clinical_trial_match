      RATIONALE: Dasatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. It may also make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy.
      Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by
      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase I/II trial is studying the best dose of dasatinib and to see
      how well it works compared with a placebo when given together with radiation therapy and
      temozolomide in treating patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To establish a maximum-tolerated dose of dasatinib combined with radiation and
           temozolomide in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. (Phase I) (Phase
           I study closed to patient accrual on April 29, 2011 and has been completed)

        -  To determine the efficacy of dasatinib in combination with radiotherapy and concomitant
           adjuvant temozolomide, and compare it with the standard of care approach, consisting of
           radiotherapy and temozolomide, followed by adjuvant temozolomide in these patients.
           (Phase II) (Phase II study opened to patient accrualon August 5, 2011)

        -  To determine the relationship between tumor biomarkers and clinical outcome of patients
           treated with the dasatinib/radiotherapy/temozolomide combination. (Phase II)

        -  To evaluate potential mechanisms of therapy resistance in recurrent tumor samples
           obtained at the time of surgery for recurrent disease.

        -  To assess the impact of the addition of dasatinib to radiotherapy and temozolomide on
           the quality of life (QOL) of these patients, as assessed by FACT-Br, EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL,
           and EORTC QLQ-BN20. (Phase II)

        -  To compare the results of the two most commonly used QOL tools, FACT-Br and EORTC QLQ
           C15-PAL plus BN20 and validate the use of EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL plus BN20 in these
           patients.(Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I dose-escalation study of dasatinib (Phase I study
      closed to patient accrual on April 29, 2011 and has been completed) followed by a randomized
      phase II study (Phase II study opened to patient accrual on August 5, 2011).

        -  Phase I:

             -  Course 1: Patients receive oral dasatinib once daily and oral temozolomide once
                daily on days 1-42. Patients undergo external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT), including
                intensity-modulated radiotherapy, 5 days a week for 6 weeks.

             -  Courses 2-7: Beginning 28-42 days after course 1, patients receive oral dasatinib
                once daily on days 1-28 and oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5. Treatment
                repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
                unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Patients are stratified according to age (&gt; 70 years vs ≤ 70 years). Patients
           are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

             -  Arm I:

                  -  Course 1: Patients receive oral dasatinib once daily and oral temozolomide
                     once daily on days 1-42. Patients undergo EBRT 5 days a week for 6 weeks.

                  -  Courses 2-7: Beginning 28-42 days after course 1, patients receive oral
                     dasatinib once daily on days 1-28 and oral temozolomide once daily on days
                     1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease
                     progression or unacceptable toxicity.

             -  Arm II:

                  -  Course 1: Patients receive oral placebo once daily on days 1-42 and
                     temozolomide as in arm I. Patients also undergo EBRT as in arm I.

                  -  Courses 2-7: Beginning 28-42 days after course 1, patients receive oral
                     placebo once daily on days 1-28 and temozolomide as in arm I. Treatment
                     repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
                     unacceptable toxicity.

      Tissue samples are collected for correlative studies.

      Quality of life is assessed periodically using the FACT-Br, EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL v.1, and EORTC
      BN-20 questionnaires.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 6 months for 5 years.
