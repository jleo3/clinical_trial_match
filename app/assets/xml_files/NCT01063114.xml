  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are two types of external radiation treatments (proton beam and photon beam).  As part
      of the participant's treatment, they will receive radiation to the entire central nervous
      system (CNS); this is known as craniospinal irradiation (CSI).  In the past, photon
      radiation therapy has been used for CSI.  In this study we will be examining the effects of
      proton beam radiation therapy. Studies have suggested that this kind of radiation can cause
      less damage to normal tissue than photon radiation therapy.  The physical characteristics of
      proton beam radiation let the doctor safely deliver the amount of radiation delivered to the
      tumor that is normally delivered through standard therapy but spare more normal tissue in
      the process.

      -  Before beginning radiation therapy, participants will have scans done in order to
           prepare for the radiation treatment.  Doctors will use information gathered from these
           scans to plan the best way to deliver radiation to the tumor.

        -  The following procedures will be performed either before or during the radiotherapy:
           Hearing exam; neurocognitive exam; blood tests and cerebral spinal fluid test.

        -  Not everyone who participates in this study will receive the same amount of proton
           radiation therapy.  The length of time and amount of radiation received will depend
           upon the condition of the participant's disease.  Radiation treatment will be given
           once a day, 5 days a week (Monday-Friday).  The overall treatment course will be
           approximately 6 weeks.
