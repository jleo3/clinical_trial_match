  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a variety of tumors affecting the pituitary gland in childhood; some of these
      tumors  (eg craniopharyngioma) are included among the most common central nervous system
      tumors in childhood. The gene(s) involved in the pathogenesis of these tumors are largely
      not known; their possible association with other developmental defects or inheritance
      pattern(s) has not been investigated. The present study serves as a (i) screening/training,
      and, (ii) a research protocol.

      As a screening and training study, this protocol allows our Institute to admit children with
      tumors of the hypothalamic-pituitary unit to the pediatric endocrine clinics and wards of
      the NIH Clinical Center for the purposes of

      (i) training our fellows and students in the identification of genetic defects associated
      with pituitary tumor formation, and

      (ii) teaching our fellows and students the recognition, management and complications of
      pituitary tumors

      As a research study, this protocol aims at

      (i) developing new clinical studies for the recognition and therapy of pituitary tumors; as
      an example, two new studies have emerged within the context of this protocol: (a)
      investigation of a new research magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tool and its usefulness in
      the identification of pituitary tumors, and (b) investigation of the psychological effects
      of cortisol secretion in pediatric patients with Cushing disease. Continuation of this
      protocol will eventually lead to new, separate protocols that will address all aspects of
      diagnosis of pituitary tumors and their therapy in childhood.

      (ii) Identifying the genetic components of pituitary oncogenesis; those will be investigated
      by (a) studying the inheritance pattern of pituitary tumors in childhood and their possible
      association with other conditions in the families of the patients, and (ii) collecting tumor
      tissues and examining their molecular genetics. As with the clinical studies, the present
      protocol may help generate ideas for future studies on the treatment and clinical follow up
      of pediatric patients with tumors of the pituitary gland and, thus, lead to the development
      of better therapeutic regimens for these neoplasms.
