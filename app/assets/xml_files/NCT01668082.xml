  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to use infusion of a non-radioactive, naturally occurring isotope of
      glucose (13C) in patients undergoing surgical resection for a newly identified brain mass to
      obtain the metabolic phenotype of the tumor, and correlate it with the histopathological
      diagnosis.  In each patient, 13C NMR spectral analysis of tumor extracts will be obtained
      after intra-operative infusion of [U-13C]glucose or [1,2-13C]glucose.  Whenever feasible,
      patients will undergo 3 preoperative imaging studies - 18FDG-PET, diffusion tensor imaging
      with 1H-spectroscopy on 3T MR scanner, and ultra high resolution MR imaging on the 7T MR
      scanner.  The results of these imaging studies will be correlated with the metabolic
      phenotype to generate a comprehensive non-invasive view of the tumor with the goal of
      identifying infiltrative, metabolically active tumor cells within the brain.  In addition, a
      comprehensive molecular profile of the tumor will be obtained and enable a
      genotype-metabolic phenotype comparative analysis.

      Correlative Translational Research The investigators will obtain tumor tissue from each
      patient for comprehensive molecular analysis (array CGH, expression profiling, methylation
      profiling) which will be correlated with tumor histology, the metabolites identified by
      1H-MR spectroscopy and the 13Cglucose metabolic profile.  Patients will be followed at
      designated time points along their treatment course to obtain information about ongoing
      treatment and response, time to tumor progression and overall survival.  These parameters
      will be used in correlational analysis with the metabolic phenotype.
