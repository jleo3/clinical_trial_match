    <textblock>
      The Methodist Hospital Neurological Institute is conducting a clinical trial for patients
      suffering from Metastatic brain tumors. The objective for this study is to evaluate the
      safety and feasibility of a MRI-guided laser thermal therapy during a real-time MRI guidance
      for the treatment of brain metastasis.

      Patient will undergo laser therapy using the MRI scan to plan the treatment and ensure
      proper placement of the laser within the tumor. The tumor will then be heated by the laser
      and monitored by study physicians through the real-time MRI to see and control temperatures
      in the tissue. One in place, the thermal laser will then surgically remove the lesions.
      After the procedure, post treatment MR images will thenbe acquired for the determination of
      the effective treatment region.

      This is a study for evaluating the feasibility and safety of MR-guided laser thermal
      ablation of treatment-resistant brain tumors using the Visualase® Thermal Therapy System
      (Manufactured by BioTex, Inc., Houston, TX). The Visualase system is FDA cleared for soft
      tissue ablation in a number of surgical specialties including Neurosurgery (see appendix for
      documentation). Patients with intracranial brain tumors measuring 3 cm or smaller in largest
      diameter that have failed any conventional therapy (surgery, stereotactic radiosurgery
      and/or whole brain radiotherapy) are eligible.

      The target tissue containing the tumor will undergo MRI-guided laser induced thermal
      therapy. MR imaging is used to define the treatment volume as well as plan and verify
      placement of the applicator. The extent of ablation is quantitatively monitored and
      displayed during delivery using real-time, MR temperature imaging. MR temperature imaging
      will also be used to monitor and control the temperature of adjacent tissues. Treatment will
      be automatically stopped if the MR temperature feedback system reports the temperature in
      the adjacent tissue has risen above a preset threshold. Treatment can be manually stopped by
      the neurosurgeon monitoring the treatment in real-time at any point during the procedure by
      simply turning off the power to the laser from the Visualase® system console. After laser
      delivery, MR images can be used to verify the extent of treatment and plan a therapy
      delivery if necessary.

An MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is a exam that creates pictures using magnetic rays instead of x-rays.  The tumor(s) will then be heated by the laser in an attempt to eliminate their presence.  The physician will be able to see and control the temperature of the laser.</description>
