      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as vincristine, cisplatin, lomustine, and cyclophosphamide, work in
      different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving
      radiation therapy with chemotherapy after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells. It is
      not yet known whether standard-dose radiation therapy combined with chemotherapy after
      surgery is more effective than reduced-dose craniospinal (head and spine) radiation therapy
      plus either posterior fossa (back of the brain) boost or tumor bed (site of the tumor) boost
      radiation therapy combined with chemotherapy in treating medulloblastoma.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying standard-dose radiation therapy to see
      how well it works compared to reduced-dose craniospinal radiation therapy AND posterior
      fossa boost radiation therapy to see how well it works compared to tumor bed boost radiation
      therapy when given together with chemotherapy in treating young patients who have undergone
      surgery for newly diagnosed standard-risk medulloblastoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare event-free and overall survival of pediatric patients (3 to 7 years of age)
           with newly diagnosed standard-risk medulloblastoma treated with standard-dose vs
           reduced-dose craniospinal radiotherapy and posterior fossa boost vs tumor bed boost
           radiotherapy in combination with chemotherapy comprising vincristine, cisplatin,
           lomustine, and cyclophosphamide.

        -  Compare event-free and overall survival of these patients (8 to 21 years of age)
           treated with standard-dose craniospinal radiotherapy and posterior fossa boost vs tumor
           bed boost radiotherapy in combination with this chemotherapy regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Compare patterns of failure in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the cognitive, auditory, and endocrinologic effects of these regimens in these
           patients.

        -  Compare the audiologic and endocrinologic toxicity from these regimens in these
           patients.

        -  Develop an optimal gene expression medulloblastoma outcome predictor.

        -  Assess quality of life and functional status in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients will undergo radiotherapy on days
      1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, 36-40, and 43-47 (weeks 0-6). Patients receive vincristine
      IV on days 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, and 43 (weeks 1-6) beginning 31 days after surgery.Patients 3
      to 7 years of age are randomized to 1 of 2 chemoradiotherapy arms. Patients 8-21 years old
      are assigned to arm II.

        -  Chemoradiotherapy:Patients will undergo radiotherapy on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26,
           29-33, 36-40, and 43-47 (weeks 0-6). Patients receive vincristine IV on days 8, 15, 22,
           29, 36, and 43 (weeks 1-6) beginning 31 days after surgery. Patients 3 to 7 years of
           age are randomized to 1 of 2 radiotherapy arms (arms I and II). Patients 8-21 years old
           are assigned to arm II.

             -  Radiotherapy (first randomization):

                  -  Arm I: Patients undergo reduced-dose craniospinal radiotherapy with boost.

                  -  Arm II: Patients undergo standard-dose craniospinal radiotherapy with boost.
                     All patients are then randomized to 1 of 2 chemoradiotherapy arms (arms III
                     and IV).

             -  Radiotherapy boost (second randomization):

                  -  Arm III: Patients will undergo radiotherapy boost to the entire posterior
                     fossa.

                  -  Arm IV: Patients will undergo radiotherapy boost to the tumor bed only.

        -  Maintenance chemotherapy: Beginning 4 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy,
           patients receive 2 different regimens of maintenance chemotherapy for a total of 9
           courses. Each course in regimen A is 6 weeks (42 days) in duration. Each course in
           regimen B is 4 weeks (28 days) in duration.

             -  Regimen A (courses 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8): Patients receive oral lomustine and
                cisplatin IV over 6 hours on day 1 and vincristine IV on days 1, 8, and 15 of
                weeks 11, 17, 27, 33, 43, and 49.

             -  Regimen B (courses 3, 6, and 9): Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour
                on days 1 and 2 and vincristine IV on days 1 and 8 of weeks 23, 39, and 55.

      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at 3-6 months after completion of radiotherapy and at 3-4 years
      after study entry. Neurocognitive function may also be assessed.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then
      annually thereafter.
