      This study involves cancer research and the purpose is to assess the safety and activity of
      a type of vaccine as immune therapy for cancer.

      This vaccine will be made from each participant's own immune cells (called dendritic cells)
      obtained by blood donation. Dendritic cells (DCs) are immune cells whose role is to identify
      foreign material in the body (such as bacteria, viruses, or tumor cells).

      When DCs recognize this material, they use it to activate other cells of the immune system
      to mount an attack against that foreign material. In the Laboratory of Molecular
      Neuro-Oncology, each participant's DCs will be loaded with samples of their own tumor cells
      that were obtained at surgical resection. These tumor cells are killed in the laboratory
      using a special protocol, and then &quot;fed&quot; to the DCs. The DCs &quot;eat&quot; this material, and these
      &quot;fed&quot; DCs make up the vaccine.

      If you are eligible, and you decide to join this research study, you will get two to three
      shots of the experimental vaccine, each three weeks apart.

      You will then have a follow up period where we will monitor you and your medical records for
      any affects of the experimental treatment.

        completed within 45 days fo study entry.

          1. Disease Characteristics

             Histologically confirmed brain cancers, reviewed at MSKCC.  Pathologic examination
             will be of surgical resection specimens deemed of suitable quality for definitive
             diagnosis by the histopathologist.

               -  All histological grade of disease accepted

             Surgically accessible tumor for which resection is indicated.  Tumors may be from
             initial resections or re-resections.  Recovery of a minimum of 1x10^7 tumor cells ex
             vivo is required.
