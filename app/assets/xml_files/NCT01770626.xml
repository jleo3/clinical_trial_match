  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to evaluate how the composition of a participant's body, diagnosed
      with a brain tumor (glioblastoma multiforme) as determined by bioelectrical impedance
      analysis can predict the progression and outcomes of  disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to monitor the nutritional status of (Glioblastoma
      Multiforme)GBM patients for one year. We will look at the relationships between phase angle
      determined by Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA), nutrition assessment by Subjective
      Global Assessment and serum albumin, the type of microbes present in the gut, the
      participant's DNA information, and tumor progression. We will also compare estimated caloric
      needs determined by BIA and Harris Benedict Equation to Resting Energy Expenditure from
      Indirect Calorimetry of the people with GBM and the people without.
