  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emergence hypertension is a common occurrence in patients emerging from general anesthesia.
      This elevation of arterial pressure is particularly concerning in patients undergoing
      craniotomy due to increased risk of morbidity and mortality in patients with altered
      intracranial elastance. Thus, identifying better methods to attenuate the hemodynamic
      changes associated with emergence from anesthesia can improve patient safety, especially in
      the neurosurgical patient.

      Nicardipine is more effective than esmolol as a sole agent in maintaining blood pressure
      within goal range in the setting of emergence hypertension after craniotomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emergence hypertension following craniotomy is a well-described, albeit poorly understood,
      phenomenon.  Strict control of blood pressure is of utmost importance during and after
      neurosurgical procedures; failure to prevent acute rises in arterial blood pressure places
      patients at increased risk of intracranial bleeding, cerebral edema, increased intracranial
      pressure, and prolonged hospital stays. Emergence hypertension after craniotomy seems to be
      the result of an acute and transient increase in catecholamine release, peripheral
      vasoconstriction, and reduced barorecepor sensitivity. Prior investigations have
      demonstrated that treatment with antihypertensive agents is required in 60 to 90% of
      neurosurgical patients postoperatively.1 Given the common occurrence of emergence
      hypertension after craniotomy and the increased risk of potentially devastating events that
      may occur in the setting of acute increases in arterial blood pressure, it is important to
      identify how best to manage these hemodynamic changes.

      An ideal drug for the management of emergence hypertension would be a short-acting,
      parenteral drug that is easily and rapidly titratable. Medications commonly utilized include
      nicardipine, labetolol, and esmolol. When given as a bolus, nicardipine, a calcium channel
      blocker, demonstrates a maximal response in &lt;2 minutes and a mean half-life of approximately
      40 minutes. Nicardipine is also frequently administered as an infusion; however, time to
      onset is increased if no bolus is administered and duration of action may be 4-6 hours after
      prolonged infusion.1 Labetolol, a non-selective beta-blocker, demonstrates onset in 10-20
      seconds with peak activity at 5 minutes.5  Esmolol is an ultra-short-acting, B1-beta-blocker
      that has rapid onset and is quickly metabolized by nonspecific red blood cell esterases;
      however, esmolol primarily results in decreased heart rate and demonstrates less effect on
      blood pressure.

    <description>Subjects will receive a 15 mcg/kg bolus of nicardipine as needed followed by an infusion initiated at 5 mg/hr. Nicardipine may be titrated every 5 minutes, increasing 5 mg/hr and administering 15 mcg/kg bolus every minute to a maximum dose of 15 mg/hr.  If SBP is not maintained &lt; 140 mmHg 5 minutes after achieving the maximum dose of nicardipine, medication &quot;failure&quot; will be declared and rescue drug (medication to be determined per anesthesiologist discretion) will be administered.  Infusions may be titrated down if SBP decreases below 90 mmHg.</description>
