      This Phase I/II trial studies the ability to stop brain metastases from coming back after
      treatment with radiosurgery followed by surgical resection. It will also evaluate the side
      effects of these combined treatments and help determine the best radiosurgery dose.
      Radiosurgery focuses the x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to the normal
      tissue in the brain.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety (risk of acute and long-term toxicities) of neoadjuvant
      radiosurgery at escalating doses followed by surgical resection of brain metastases. (Phase
      I)

      II. To determine the local control of brain metastases treated with neoadjuvant radiosurgery
      followed by surgical resection. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the rate of distant brain failure when brain metastases are managed with
      neoadjuvant radiosurgery followed by surgical resection.

      II. To estimate the rate of salvage surgery, whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT), or
      stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for patients treated with neoadjuvant radiosurgery followed
      by surgical resection.

      III. To estimate neurocognitive outcomes for patients treated with neoadjuvant radiosurgery
      followed by surgical resection.

      IV. To determine the rate of radiation necrosis/steroid dependency. V. To estimate quality
      of life for patients treated with neoadjuvant radiosurgery followed by surgical resection.

      VI. To determine the radiobiologic impact of neoadjuvant radiosurgery for resected brain
      metastases.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of radiosurgery followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients undergo radiosurgery on day 0. Within 2 weeks, patients undergo surgical resection.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.
