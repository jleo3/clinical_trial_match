  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients undergoing craniotomy, 0.9% normal saline is commonly administered in order to
      reduce cerebral edema. Excessive administration of 0.9% normal saline has been to reported
      to cause hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. On the other hand, hypovolemia due to
      insufficient fluid replacement for perioperative loss can also result in metabolic acidosis
      by lactic acid accumulation. However, the guideline for perioperative fluid management has
      not been yet established. The investigators hypothesized that intraoperative fluid
      management according to SVV(Stroke Volume Variation)could reduce perioperative metabolic
      acidosis compared to those by CVP(Central Venous Pressure). Therefore, the study is trying
      to determine if intraoperative fluid administration based on SVV could reduce metabolic
      acidosis when compared with CVP in patients undergoing craniotomy due to brain tumor who
      receive 0.9% normal saline as main fluid regimen.
