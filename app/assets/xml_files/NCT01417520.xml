      Background:

      - Erdheim Chester Disease (ECD) is a very rare disease in which abnormal white blood cells
      start growing and affect the bones, kidneys, skin, and brain. ECD can cause severe lung
      disease, kidney failure, heart disease, and other complications that lead to death. Because
      ECD is a rare disease, found mostly in men over 40 years of age, there is no standard
      treatment for it. More information is needed to find out what genes can cause ECD and how
      best to treat it.

      Objectives:

      - To collect study samples and medical information on people with Erdheim Chester Disease.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals 2 to 80 year of age who have been diagnosed with Erdheim Chester Disease.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.

        -  Participants will have a study visit to provide samples for study, including blood,
           urine, and skin tissue samples. Participants will also have lung, heart, and muscle
           function tests; imaging studies of the brain, chest, and whole body; a treadmill
           running stress test; an eye exam; and other tests as needed by the study doctors.

        -  Participants will be asked to return for a similar set of tests every 2 years, and to
           remain in contact for possible treatment options.

    <textblock>
      Erdheim-Chester Diseases (ECD) is a very rare non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis of unknown
      origin and pathogenesis. It has been reported mainly in adult males over the age of 40
      years, although cases have been reported in females as well. Children are rarely affected by
      this condition. No causative gene has been identified; family studies have not been
      performed due to the rarity and sporadic nature of the disease. The clinical characteristics
      of ECD range from asymptomatic to multisystemic involvement; longitudinal progression and
      natural history have not been well documented. ECD commonly affects the bones, kidneys,
      retroperitoneal space, skin and brain. After diagnosis, the disease progresses rapidly,
      causing fatal outcomes due to severe lung disease, chronic renal failure, cardiomyopathy and
      other complications. The diagnosis of ECD relies upon imaging studies and specific
      pathologic findings in biopsies of affected organs, i.e., fibrosis and infiltration of the
      affected tissues with foamy histiocytes, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. Immunohistochemistry
      reveals cells positive for CD68 and negative for CD1a and S-100. There is no standard
      treatment for ECD, although chemotherapy, radiation, stem cell transplantion,
      alpha-interferon, steroids and sirolimus have been proposed. Symptomatic improvement has
      been reported with some of these therapies, but death within a few years after diagnosis
      remains the expected outcome. In this protocol, we will clinically evaluate ECD patients,
      obtain cells, plasma, and urine, search for genes that can be responsible for ECD, and
      perform other studies dictated by each patient's presentation.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  ECD patients of any gender and ethnicity age 2-80 years

          -  Patients will be diagnosed as having ECD based upon pathologic evaluations of
             affected organs.

          -  Family members are also invited to be part of the study. They will undergo a limited
             evaluation at the NIH Clinical Center

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients will be excluded if they have a suspected diagnosis of ECD not confirmed by
             biopsy or another form of histiocytosis or cannot travel to the NIH because of their
             medical condition.

          -  Children under age two year are excluded because there is no urgency for a very early
             diagnosis and care is more readily provided to older children at the Clinical Center.

          -  Pregnant women will not be able to be part of this study because of the risks that
             can be harmful to the fetus.
