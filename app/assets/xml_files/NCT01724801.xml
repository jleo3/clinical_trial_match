      EGFR-TKI is good for the patients with EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer.We design this
      clinical trail to confirm if the efficacy of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine
      Kinase Inhibitor(EGFR-TKI )(ICOTINIB) is better than whole brain irradiation for the patient
      with EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer.
