      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs, such as
      riluzole, may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Giving riluzole together
      with whole-brain radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of riluzole when
      given together with whole-brain radiation therapy in treating patients with brain
      metastases.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of riluzole that can be administered
           concurrently with standard whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) in patients with multiple
           brain metastases.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the long-term toxicity of riluzole when administered with WBRT.

        -  To assess neurocognitive function before and after treatment with riluzole and WBRT.

        -  To determine the MRI response of brain metastasis after treatment with riluzole and
           WBRT.

        -  To compare survival of patients treated with riluzole and WBRT to published historical
           data for patients with brain metastases.

        -  To evaluate the response of brain metastasis to riluzole and WBRT as a function of the
           expression of glutamate receptors on the primary tumor specimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of riluzole.

      Patients receive oral riluzole twice daily beginning on day 0. Beginning within 2 days after
      the initiation of riluzole, patients undergo whole-brain radiotherapy for 15 fractions.

      Patients undergo neurocognitive and quality-of-life assessments at baseline, at 5 weeks, and
      at 3 months.

      Tumor tissue samples are collected for laboratory biomarker studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 weeks, every 3 months for
      2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.
