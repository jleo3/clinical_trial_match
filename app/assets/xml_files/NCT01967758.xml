    <textblock>
      This is a study for patients with brain tumors called astrocytic tumors.  The study will
      enroll patients who have received standard treatment.  The study will test a vaccine called
      ADU-623.  ADU-623 has not been tested in humans before, so the goal of this study is to see
      if ADU-623 can be given safely to brain cancer patients and what is the better dose to give
      patients among the three doses that planned to be tested.  This study will also evaluate the
      length of time before patients' cancer worsens and if ADU-623 helps patients to live longer.
       The study will also measure the body's immune system response to ADU-623.

      This Phase I clinical trial will examine the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a
      novel vaccine approach using a live-attenuated strain of Listeria monocytogenes expressing
      EGFRvIII and NY-ESO-1 antigens to induce proliferation of memory and effector T cells with
      the overall goal of promoting an immune response against high-grade astrocytic tumors.

    <description>The primary objective of this trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)(up to a dose of 1x10^9 cfu IV) and characterize the safety profile of ADU-623 vaccine in patients with recurrent WHO Grade III/IV Astrocytomas. The MTD will be defined as the highest dose at which none or one out of 6 patients experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) that is possibly or probably related to the vaccine.</description>

             peripheral vascular disease or psychiatric illness.

          -  Have insufficient peripheral venous access to permit completion of the study dosing

          -  Other medical or psychiatric conditions that in the opinion of the Principal
             Investigator would preclude safe participation in protocol.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women, as treatment has unknown effect on the embryo or child.

          -  Patients requiring chronic corticosteroid use will be excluded as this may mask toxic
