      The purpose of this research study to determine if treating recurrent malignant gliomas with
      another person's (donor) immune system cells known as aCTL cells, will be safe. This study
      will also try to determine if persons who receive aCTL's are more or less likely to survive
      their brain tumor than persons who had similar tumors in the past. Approximately 15 patients
      will be enrolled at UCLA.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

        To participate in this clinical trial, patients must meet the following eligibility
        criteria:

          1. Subjects must have a histologically proven diagnosis of malignant glioma or
             meningioma and been treated with prior standard radiation and chemotherapy. There
             must be evidence of unequivocal progression by MRI.

          2. Tumor must be amenable to resection, and surgical resection must be clinically
             indicated.

          3. Age at least 18 years.

          4. Karnofsky performance scale score &gt;60.

          5. Adequate hematologic function:  a) systemic white blood cell count greater than 2 x
             103/mm3, b) platelet count greater than 100,000/mm3, c) hematocrit greater than 25%.

          6. Adequate renal function, with creatinine less than two times the upper limit.

          7. Adequate hepatic function, with SGOT, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin &lt; 2x
             upper limit of normal.

          8. Patients must have an expected survival of at least three months.

          9. Patients must not have a history of HTLV, HIV, syphilis by RPR, hepatitis B and C.

         10. Patients must sign an informed consent.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

        Patients will be excluded from the trial if the patients:

          1. have multifocal tumors, bihemispheric tumors, infratentorial tumors, or
             non-surgically accessible tumors.

          2. have prior tumor resections where the ventricles were extensively breached.

          3. are pregnant or breast-feeding women.

          4. are females of child-bearing potential unable or unwilling to practice adequate birth
             control methods.

          5. have contraindications for brain MRI scanning (e.g., intra-ocular metal fragments,
             cerebral aneurysm clips, pacemaker).

          6. have concurrent malignancy, excluding curatively treated basal or squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix.

          7. have concurrent systemic infection.

          8. have any clinically significant, uncontrolled medical illness, as determined by the
             investigators.

          9. are unwilling or unable to comply with procedures required in this protocol.
