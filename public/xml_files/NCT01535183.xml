  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The outcome of pediatric refractory or relapsed brain tumor is very dismal. Standard
      chemotherapy showed poor response to these patients. Although tandem high dose chemotherapy
      with hematopoietic progenitor stem cell rescues has been chosen as a potentially curative
      therapy for long term survival and better outcome is expected if tumor burden before
      transplantation reduced by chemotherapy, effective salvage chemotherapy for tumor reduction
      is not established yet. Irinotecan is a recently developed topoisomerase I inhibitor, and
      there are preclinical and phase I, II data which proved practical effects in brain tumors.
      In those studies, irinotecan was administered alone or in combination with one other drug.

      Vincristine, etoposide, carboplatin, and cyclophosphamide have been used in many protocols
      for brain tumors but the result was very poor in refractory or relapsed cases. However,
      irinotecan can be effective with these multiple chemotherapeutic agents. According to the
      pilot study of irinotecan in combination with vincristine, etoposide, carboplatin and
      cyclophosphamide in the investigators center, 75% percent of total 12 patients reached more
      than stable disease, and 2 patients got long term complete remission only with this
      multi-agent combination chemotherapy. But the combination of irinotecan, vincristine,
      etoposide, carboplatin, and cyclophosphamide is not clinically studied yet especially for
      pediatric patients. To improve response rate and progression-free survival, the combination
      chemotherapy of irinotecan, vincristine, etoposide, carboplatin, and cyclophosphamide is
      designed for pediatric refractory or relapsed brain tumor.
