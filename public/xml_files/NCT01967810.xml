  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 study to see if an investigational drug, ANG1005, can shrink tumor cells
      in patients with high-grade glioma. Another purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy,
      safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of ANG1005 in patients.
