    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that a subset of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome/ myalgic
      encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME), including also patients with no clinical response after B-cell
      depletion therapy using the anti-CD20 antibody Rituximab, may benefit from tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha inhibition using Etanercept as weekly subcutaneous injections.
