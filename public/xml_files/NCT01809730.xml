  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, non-interventional pilot observational study designed to follow
      high-risk patients through their surgical and hospital stay.  The investigators will collect
      2 4ml vial's of blood (total of 8ml) prior to surgery to assess CV biomarkers -
      inflammatory, metabolic, hypercoagulable and platelet.

      This study is primarily an observational pilot study.  After identifying patients as
      high-risk according to the following criteria: CAD and/or CVD and/or PAD and/or  &gt;=60 years
      old and at least 2 of the following - renal insufficiency, diabetes, COPD, hypertension,
      active smoker (or active within 6 months of consent), cancer, congestive heart failure, or
      any blood clot - they will be asked to sign a consent form.  Patients surgical and hospital
      course will continue as per standard of care.  Prior to surgery, 8ml of blood will be
      collected for to assess cardiovascular biomarkers including inflammatory, metabolic,
      hypercoagulable and platelet biomarkers to be tested independently in Dr. Berger's lab in
      Smilow.  Study staff will perform electrocardiograms on POD 2.  Results of these ECGs will
      not be placed in the patients' charts.  No other procedures will be done for research
      purposes only.

        This pilot, observational study is designed to identify and follow orthopedic surgical
        patients meeting specific high-risk criteria for postoperative cardiovascular events.  All
        normal standard of care will be maintained.  Patients will be observed from Pre-Admission
        Testing (PAT) visit through hospital discharge.
