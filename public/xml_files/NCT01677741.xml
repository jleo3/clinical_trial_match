  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part, study to determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of oral
      dabrafenib in pediatric subjects with advanced BRAF V600 mutation-positive solid tumors.
      Part 1 (dose escalation study) will identify the recommended Part 2 (tumor-specific
      expansion study) dose and regimen using a dose-escalation procedure.

      Approximately 6 to 18 subjects will participate in Part 1 and will receive a starting dose
      of 3 mg/kg and dose will deescalate or escalate between 1.5 milligram (mg)/kilogram (kg) and
      4.5 mg/kg. Up to 6 subjects will be enrolled at one dose level dependent upon the number of
      subjects at the current dose level, the number of subjects who have experienced a dose
      limiting toxicity (DLT) at the current dose level, and the number of subjects enrolled but
      with data pending at the current dose level. Escalation may proceed until either a maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is established, or until the dose in which the median pharmacokinetic
      parameters consistent with exposure in adults are achieved. Cohorts may be added in order to
      evaluate additional dose levels.

      Part 2 consists of four disease-specific cohorts of subjects with tumors known to have BRAF
      V600 activation (pediatric low-grade gliomas, pediatric high-grade gliomas, Langerhans cell
      histiocytosis [LCH], and other tumors such as melanoma and papillary thyroid carcinoma
      [PTC]). Each cohort will enroll at least 10 subjects with a pre-dose and at least 1
      post-dose disease assessment.

      In both the parts of the study, on Day 1, a single first dose will be administered, and
      repeat dosing will begin on Day 2. PK sampling will be performed on Day 1 and Day 15 for
      subjects &gt;=25 kg in weight. For subjects &lt;25 kg in weight, blood samples for PK analysis
      will be collected after repeated administration on Day 15 only.

      Safety and tolerability will be assessed throughout the study. Treatment with dabrafenib
      will be continued until disease progression or until no clinical benefit or development of
      an unacceptable toxicity, or until they withdraw consent or begin a new therapy. At the end
      of treatment, a final study visit will occur.

    <description>Three subjects will receive a single dose of 3 mg/kg dabrafenib on Day 1 and repeat dose will begin from Day 2, evenly divided in two daily doses. Once all 3 subjects have been fully evaluated for the first 28 days (including Day 15 PK) and no DLTs are observed, a next subject will be enrolled at the next higher dose levels (i.e., dose escalation to 3.75 mg/kg [+1] and may be further to 4.5 mg/kg [+2]). If all 3 subjects have not been fully evaluated for the first 28 days or 1 DLT occurred, the fourth subject will be enrolled at the same dose level. If 2 or more DLTs are observed, the next subject will be enrolled at the next lower dose level (i.e., de-escalated to 2.25 mg/kg [-1] and may be further to 1.5 mg/kg [-2]). Similarly, the process is repeated for the fifth and sixth subjects in a cohort. All subjects will receive treatment till end of study.</description>

             chemotherapy)

          -  Has leukaemia
