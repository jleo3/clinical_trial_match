  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cancer who develop stroke are at high risk for future strokes or other
      clotting events. These patients are routinely treated with medicines that thin their blood,
      including enoxaparin or aspirin. However, it is unclear which medicine is best and whether
      these medicines can be adequately studied in a clinical trial.

      The purpose of this Phase I/II study is to determine if a clinical trial of different blood
      thinners in patients with cancer and stroke is possible. In addition, the study aims to
      compare the effects, good and/or bad, of enoxaparin with those of aspirin on patients with
      cancer and recent stroke.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Any adult patient with active systemic cancer diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke at the
        main MSKCC campus or any of MSKCC's New York City outpatient centers within the prior four
        weeks would be eligible.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 to 85 years of age.

          -  Active cancer, defined as a pathologic diagnosis of or treatment for any cancer,
             other than basal-cell or squamous-cell carcinoma of the skin, within the past six
             months; or patients with known recurrent or metastatic disease within the past six
             months.

          -  First-ever acute ischemic stroke within the prior four weeks, defined as a new
             neurologic deficit(s) with MRI evidence of acute ischemia in a referable location,
             and no clinical or radiologic indication of a non-cerebrovascular mimic, such as a
             brain metastasis, as the etiology of the deficit(s).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to get brain MRI

          -  Known malignant primary brain tumor.

          -  Diagnosis of intracranial hemorrhage within the past 3 months, including intratumoral
             hemorrhage into brain metastases from a systemic cancer.

          -  Active or serious bleeding within two weeks of enrollment.

          -  Patient condition associated with a high risk of bleeding such as recent surgery or
             peptic ulcer disease.

          -  Clear indication for anticoagulation (e.g., atrial fibrillation) anticipated during
             the study period.

          -  Clear indication for antiplatelet agents (e.g., cardiac stents); a patient receiving
             aspirin for primary prevention prior to index stroke may be enrolled as long as study
             investigators believe it would be safe for the patient to stop aspirin if the patient
             was randomized to the enoxaparin arm.

          -  Active bleeding diathesis.

          -  Platelet count of ≤ 70,000/mm3, an international normalized ratio (INR) &gt; 1.6, or a
             partial thromboplastin time (PTT) &gt; 40 seconds.

          -  Known allergy to heparin or aspirin or a history of heparin induced thrombocytopenia.

          -  Serum creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dl.

          -  AST or ALT &gt; 200 U/L.

          -  Hemoglobin &lt; 8 gm/dl

          -  Symptomatic carotid stenosis.

          -  Active pregnancy.

          -  Life expectancy &lt; 1 month or current hospice care

          -  Unavailability for follow-up.
