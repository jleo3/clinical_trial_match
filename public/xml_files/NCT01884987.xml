    <textblock>
      Cerebral radiation necrosis (CRN) is a well-documented late complication of radiation
      therapy for cancers, and may have a devastating effect on the patient's quality of life
      (QOL). However,CRN was once regarded as a progressive and irreversible disease, no standard
      therapy has been suggested for CRN. In our clinical practice, we have used
      monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM1)to treat CRN, and found that GM1 can successfully
      reverse CRN. So we carried out this prospective study to test the efficacy of GM1 for CRN.

        Patients must have undergone definitive RT for histologically confirmed NPC years before.
        They were required to have at least two consecutive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study
        supporting the diagnosis of CRN with an interval of 3-4 months, with the second MRI
        showing progressive disease compared with the first MRI. The necrotic mass shown on MRI
        must be measured in two dimensions in order to define the response to treatment. Other
        radiologic studies were also required to support the non-existence of local or regional
        recurrence, distant metastasis. Patients must have undergone mental status examinations
        and had progressive neurologic symptoms or signs. In addition, they were required to have
        a Karnofsky performance status of at least 70 and were supposed to live more than 6
        months.
