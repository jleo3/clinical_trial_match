  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acromegaly is a condition in which too much growth hormone is made by a tumor of the
      pituitary gland.  Patients with inadequately treated acromegaly may have a higher chance of
      a number of other diseases such as heart disease, diabetes as well as a shortened life
      expectancy.  The purpose of this study is to carefully characterize the blood levels of
      hormones and other substances in the blood in patients with acromegaly over time so that we
      can gain a better understanding of those factors responsible for the excess morbidity and
      mortality in acromegaly.

      This study will follow acromegaly subjects during the therapy which has been decided by the
      patient and patient's physician.  This study will not provide therapy for acromegaly.  A
      patient qualifies as a possible study participant because the patient have been diagnosed
      with acromegaly.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be seen at diagnosis and over time after surgery if they are newly diagnosed
      or if they have already undergone surgery they will be seen over time after surgery. Visits
      will occur preoperatively and at 1, 3, 6, 12 months after surgery and then yearly for at
      least 5 years after that. Subjects who enter the study 1 year after surgery or later will be
      seen yearly for at least 5 years .

      At each visit subjects will have an interview and examination with Dr. Freda or her research
      staff, will complete a questionnaire about symptoms of acromegaly.  You will also have two
      teaspoons of blood drawn for measurement of the hormones listed above.  At the 3 month and
      12 month visits subjects will also have blood drawn for measurement of growth hormone and
      other hormones  at 60, 90 and 120 minutes after they drink an 8 ounce glass of sugar
      solution (OGTT).

      About 6 teaspoons of blood will be drawn at these visits.

      Subjects will then invited to come at yearly visits for the same procedures as listed above
      including the questionnaires, examination and blood testing including a OGTT.  At your
      discretion or at the discretion of the research team the interval may be lengthened to every
      2 to 3 years at some time in the future.  It is expected that this study will continue for
      at least ﬁve years, but it may go beyond this time period.

      If subjects receive another form of therapy for acromegaly visits will take place at the
      time intervals above during the course of your therapy.

      If subjects have undergone surgery at some time in the past they may join the study at any
      point in itscourse and undergo the procedures described above as appropriate

    <description>The study will assess the status of biochemical disease activity of acromegaly before and after treatment for acromegaly. Blood samples are taken for fasting growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 and growth hormone levels 60, 90 and 120 minutes after oral glucose.taken at baseline visit, post-operative month 1(fasting blood only), post-operative month 3(fasting blood only), post-operative month 6, post-operative month 12, and annual assessments for at least 5 years.</description>

        Subjects newly diagnosed with acromegaly or who have previously undergone surgery for
        acromegaly are invited to participate. Acromegaly subjects will be recruited primarily
        from the patients who present to Dr. Jeffrey Bruce at Columbia Presbyterian Medical
        Center, Dr. Kalmon Post at Mount Sinai Medical Center for Neurosurgery or to the Principal
        Investigator Dr. Pamela Freda at the Neuroendocrine Unit at Columbia Presbyterian Medical
        Center for evaluation of acromegaly. Subjects who have undergone surgery with other
        surgeons or followed by other Endocrinologists may be considered for participation.
