    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of hypofractionated radiosurgery
      in treating patients with large brain metastasis. Stereotactic radiosurgery can send x-rays
      directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving fractionated
      stereotactic radiosurgery may kill more tumor cells

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To demonstrate the safety and feasibility of treating brain metastases or resection
      cavities greater than 3 cm with hypofractionated radiosurgery and to determine the
      maximum-tolerated radiation dose for hypofractionated radiosurgery (HR) delivered in 5
      fractions, 2-3 fractions per week.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients undergo hypofractionated stereotactic radiosurgery 2-3 times weekly (5 fractions
      total) for 2-3 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month and then every 3
      months thereafter.
