  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim: To investigate the effect of cerebellar tumor surgery on the resting state functional
      connectivity level in higher order cognition networks known to interact with the cerebellum.
      Furthermore, to correlate the connectivity level of these networks with the
      neuropsychological performance and functional outcome of the patients.

      The investigator's hypothesis is that the functional connectivity of various cognition
      networks in the cerebrum as assessed by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
      can be impaired after cerebellar tumor surgery and can be correlated with the
      neuropsychological performance. The effect of surgery on the cognition networks and the
      neuropsychological performance  is dependent on the tumor location within the cerebellum.
      Such a correlation seems feasible as functional connectivity analysis could be correlated
      with the neuropsychological impairment in various neuropsychiatric disorders. Furthermore,
      investigators were able to depict the maturation of the functional connectivity networks in
      parallel to the neurocognitive development in childhood
