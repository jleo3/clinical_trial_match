  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study it so to determine whether a new model of care for patients late in
      life will enable patients and families to receive care that aligns with their goals and
      wishes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The care model includes a non-clinical care guide who establishes an ongoing, personal
      relationship to hear the patient's life story and understand their goals of living.  The
      other team members include a social worker, marriage and family therapist, registered nurse,
      chaplain, and pharmacist.  The team maintains a focus on the whole person so that
      non-medical as well as medical goals are established.  The care guide partners with patients
      and caregivers to get the right support from within Allina, from their community, and from
      the family's own strengths and assets.  As a result, patients and caregivers should feel
      honored and supported in the process.
