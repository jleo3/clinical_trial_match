  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided laser surgery
      (MLA) and doxorubicin hydrochloride in treating patients with recurrent glioblastoma
      multiforme. The blood brain barrier (BBB) is a separation of circulating blood from the
      tissue of the central nervous system, preventing substances in the blood from entering the
      brain. MLA disrupts the BBB around the tumor which may allow cancer-killing substances to be
      carried directly to the tumor and the surrounding area. Using MLA prior to chemotherapy may
      result in a greater concentration of drug in the tumor to kill the cancer cells while
      limiting side effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evaluate imaging techniques (MRI) and blood tests (biomarkers) to help figure out the best
      time for chemotherapy to be initiated after the blood brain barrier is disrupted, as it is
      immediately following a procedure like MRI-guided laser ablation (MLA-Monteris Neuroblate).

               -  Bilirubin ≤ 2 x ULN

          -  At the time of registration, patient must have recovered from the toxic effects of
             prior therapy to no more than grade 1 toxicity.

             she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating
             physician immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB approved written informed
             consent document (or that of legally authorized representative, if applicable).

        Exclusion Criteria - Arms B and C:

          -  Prior treatment with doxorubicin and/or bevacizumab.

          -  Prior treatment with Gliadel wafer is allowed if it has been at least 3 months from
             placement.

          -  Previous treatment with complete cumulative doses of daunorubicin, idarubicin, and/or
             other anthracyclines and anthracenediones that is equivalent to a total dose of 240

          -  More than 2 prior relapses.

          -  Currently receiving any other investigational agents that are intended as treatments

             biologic composition to doxorubicin or other agents used in the study.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, recent heart attack within the previous 12 months or severe heart
             problems, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding.  Premenopausal women must have a negative serum
             pregnancy test within 14 days of study entry.

          -  Inability to undergo MRI due to personal and medical reasons.

          -  Known HIV-positivity on combination antiretroviral therapy because of the potential
             for pharmacokinetic interactions with doxorubicin.  In addition, these patients are
             at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.
             Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination
             antiretroviral therapy when indicated.
