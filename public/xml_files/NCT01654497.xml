      The purpose of this study is to try to determine the maximum safe dose of dexanabinol that
      can be administered to people with brain cancer. Other purposes of this study are to:

        -  find out what effects (good and bad) dexanabinol has;

        -  see how much drug gets into the body by collecting blood and cerebrospinal fluid for
           use in pharmacokinetic (PK) studies;

        -  learn more about how dexanabinol might affect the growth of cancer cells;

        -  look at biomarkers (biochemical features that can be used to measure the progress of
           disease or the effects of a drug).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Protection from apoptosis is a key survival factor for cancer cells. Dexanabinol is under
      investigation as a novel anti-cancer therapy based on its tumoricidal activity observed in
      vitro and in vivo, presumably due to inhibitory activity against NFĸB, TNFα, COX-2 and
      additional putative targets suck as HAT, FAT and cyclin dependent kinases. Targeted
      induction of apoptosis in cancer cells versus normal cells provides an attractive strategy
      for the treatment of brain cancer, a pernicious disease with debilitating neurological side
      effects and poor prognoses. A single intravenous dosing of dexanabinol has demonstrated
      safety in humans. Therefore, we are conducting a phase I dose escalation study to examine
      the safety of multiple dosing of dexanabinol and drug penetration into the brain, and to
      determine a suitable dose for moving into a phase II trial for efficacy.
