  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with brain metastases who are candidates for treatment with stereotactic
      radiosurgery (SRS) are potential study participants. SRS delivers high-energy,
      precisely-focused radiation to each brain metastasis to shrink the tumor, and is the
      standard-of-care for patients with these tumors. Oxygen enhances the damaging effects of
      radiation on tumor cells.  Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy increases oxygen levels in all
      kinds of tissues, including tumors. The purpose of this trial is to study whether it is
      feasible to treat patients with HBO just prior to receiving SRS, given the timing
      constraints of treating sequentially with HBO and then SRS. Patients will undergo HBO
      treatment followed by the placement of a Gill-Thomas-Cosman head frame then transported ,via
      stretcher, to receive SRS. The transfer and placement of the head frame needs to be
      completed within the 15minute time frame.  The trial's secondary objectives are to determine
      whether it has any effects on outcomes and quality of life. As part of study participation
      patients will be asked to complete quality of life questionnaires as well as mini mental
      status questionnaires. These will be done prior to treatment and at follow up appointments
      throughout the next 3 years while participating in the study.  Patients will be given the
      option to participate in the optional bio marker blood draw study which would require
      patients to have blood drawn at three time points, pre-treatment, the day after treatment
      and at their first follow up visit.

    <description>For the primary outcome variable of feasibility,the 20 evaluable patients will be analyzed on the basis of the amount of time required from leaving the HBO chamber to beginning the SRS for the target lesion(T1).The goal for each patient is for T1 to be no greater than 15 minutes.We anticipate a learning curve for the team members of this study.
The primary endpoint of feasibility is defined as having been achieved if more than 50% of the 20 evaluable patients start SRS treatment within 30 minutes of leaving the HBO tank:in other words,T1 is &lt;=30minutes &gt;50% of evaluable patients.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Metastatic brain tumor referred to radiation oncology for treatment

          -  Size of the presenting metastatic lesion up to 4.5 cm diameter

          -  Age &gt; 18 years

          -  Patients must give informed consent indicating they are aware of the investigational
             nature of this treatment

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status &gt; 70% (Zubrod score 0 to 1)

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             prior to start of study therapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients with the following conditions are not eligible to participate in this trial:

          -  Pregnant women or women of childbearing potential without adequate contraception

          -  Evidence of pneumothorax

             o Untreated pneumothorax risks tension pneumothorax during ascent in HBO chamber

          -  COPD with C02 retention

             o Such patients can develop respiratory depression as HBO reduces their hypoxemic
             drive

          -  Uncontrolled seizure disorder

             o Note that patients on adequate antiepileptic medications may receive HBO

          -  Claustrophobia resistant to medication

             o Pre-medication with anxiolytics is generally sufficient for almost all anxious
             patients undergoing HBO treatment

          -  History of middle ear surgery o Failure to equalize pressure in the middle ear can
             cause displacement of middle ear structures with consequent hearing loss

          -  History of bleomycin administration

             o HBO can exacerbate interstitial pneumonitis in such patients

          -  Current cis-platinum chemotherapy (i.e. therapeutic levels in the bloodstream at the
             time of HBO therapy)

             o HBO can increase cytotoxicity of cis-platinum

          -  Uncontrolled high blood pressure

             o HBO can increase systemic vascular resistance

          -  Unstable angina or myocardial infarction within the previous 3 months

             o Increased afterload due to HBO can increase myocardial workload

          -  Cardiac EF ≤ 35%

               -  Pulmonary edema can arise with HBO in certain patients with severe heart failure

               -  In patients with prior history of CHF, subsequent echocardiogram and ECG are
                  required to establish EF&gt;35%

          -  Treatment with disulfiram

             o Disulfiram inhibits superoxide dismutase and is not approved for use concomitantly
             with hyperbaric oxygen therapy

          -  Active drug/alcohol dependence or abuse

          -  Lack of adequate social support structures, e.g. homelessness

          -  Tumors with potential confounding results on serum marker studies

               -  Small cell (neuroendocrine) carcinomas

               -  Carcinoid tumors
