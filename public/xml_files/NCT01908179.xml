    <textblock>
      This registry study will evaluate patients with metastatic brain tumors undergoing, or
      having undergone, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) at Swedish Medical Center. Clinical
      outcomes will be evaluated at the 3, 6 and 12-month time points. Clinical data, SRS
      treatment data, and imaging data (including anatomic and advanced imaging sequences obtained
      prior to and serially following SRS) will be archived in an online informatics platform,
      specifically a metastatic brain tumor registry known as the Comprehensive Neuro-oncology
      Data Repository for Metastatic Tumors (CONDR - Mets).
