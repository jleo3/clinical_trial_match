    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well giving vaccine therapy with or without
      bevacizumab works in treating patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme that can be
      removed by surgery. Vaccines consisting of heat shock protein-peptide complexes made from a
      person's own tumor tissue may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor
      cells that may remain after surgery. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block
      tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.
      Others find tumor cells and help kill them. It is not yet known whether giving vaccine
      therapy is more effective with or without bevacizumab in treating glioblastoma multiforme.

      The primary objective of the study is to determine whether there is an overall survival
      advantage of HSPPC-96 administered with bevacizumab, given concomitantly or at the point of
      progression, in comparison with bevacizumab alone in patients with surgically resectable
      recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. The secondary objectives are 1.) to evaluate the safety
      and tolerability of HSPPC-96 with bevacizumab and 2.) to evaluate the progression free
      survival of HSPPC-96 with bevacizumab, given concomitantly or at the point of progression.
      Patients must undergo surgery within 28 days from pre-registration. Patients will be
      randomized to one of three treatment arms post surgery. Please see the &quot;Arms&quot; section below
      for more details.

      Patients will be monitored up to 6.5 years post surgery.

(1 cycle=14 days) HSPPC-96 should be administered at least 60 minutes prior to starting bevacizumab infusion.
Note:  If HSPPC-96 treatment has ended but there is no evidence of disease progression, the patient should continue to receive bevacizumab at the specified dose until progression.</description>

NOTE:  It is possible that HSPPC-96 vaccination may end prior to evidence of progression.  In this instance it is important to wait until there is confirmed evidence of progression before initiating treatment with bevacizumab.</description>
